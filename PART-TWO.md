_Beef Sinigang_ is a Filipino dish known for its refreshing and sour tamarind-based broth. This dish is best to be served with steamed rice during cold weather or even after an exhaustful day! A _Sinigang_ can prepared with other types of protein like pork or seafoods like shrimps and local filipino fishes. But today, we will show you how to cook it with beef!

## 1. Ingredients
Any versions of *Beef Sinigang* can be prepared with different types of ingredients especially when it comes to vegetables or the type of beef cut you include. All these versions vary depending on your preference but the most important thing to remember is to always include beef bones. Beef bone will add a rich flavor to your broth. For this recipe, we will use beef short ribs because it has a good amount of fats in them, fats are flavor!

* **Protein**- 3 lbs of Beef Short Ribs
* **Water**- 10 to 12 cups of water.
* **Red Onions**- one whole onion as big as a baseball is enough.
* **Riped Tomatoes**- we prefer riped tomatoes as they provide sweetness to our broth. We can start with 2 tomatoes but you can always a little more.
* **Taro**- this can be served whole along with the other veggies or turned into paste to provide a thicker broth.
* **Water Spinach or _Kangkong_**- this is the most common greens that we add to sinigang but this ingredient is ***optional*** as they are hard to find.
* **Snake Beans or _Sitaw_**- this vegetable is similar to string beans but longer. Quantity is optional.
* **Okra**- quantity is optional.
* **Eggplant**- one whole eggplant is enough.
* **Radish**- a small radish about 6 inches long is enough.
* **Fish Sauce**- we normally use salt when we are cooking. In this version of sinigang, we will use fish sauce.
* **Tamarind**- we prefer any form of tamarind as long as it is unripe or sour.
>**Tips**: If you wanted to skip the process of extracting the puree of the tamarind. You have an option to use a sinigang mixture or powder. One popular brand for this is the Knorr Sinigang Mix. Picture below.

## 2. Recipe Preparations
1. Cut the short ribs into cubes and wash them until water is clear.
2. Cut the onions and washed tomatoes into large dices.
3. Peel the taro skins then soak them in water for a while.
4. Next, we cut the other vegetables into our desired sizes.
    * Snap or cut the water spinach or _kangkong_ in 5 inches. Or you can also take just the leaves and discard the stems.
    * Cut the snake beans or _sitaw_ at least 5 inches long.
    * For okras, just cut the tip on both ends.
    * Peel the radishes and slice them 1 inch wide.
    * Slice the eggplants 1 inch wide.
    * Lastly, wash all the vegetables to clean them.
5. If using tamarind puree, boil the tamarind separately then extract the puree.

## 3. Cooking Intructions
1. In a large pot, add water and the short ribs. Boil for at least 5 mins.
2. Remove the scums above. Or when it boiled, remove the beef from the pot and discard the water. Wash the beef and add it back to the pot with new water.
3. Add the tomatoes, onions and fish sauce.
4. With lower heat, cover the pot and let cook for 1 1/2 hrs or until beef is tender.
5. Add the taro and let it cook for another 10 mins.
6. Add the radish and let it cook for 5 mins.
7. Add the okra, snake beans and eggplant.
8. Add the tamarind puree. If using _Knorr Sinigang Mix_, add one packet or more depending on how sour you wanted the broth to be.
9. Once everything in the pot are cooked, add the water spinach.
10. Adjust the saltiness using fish sauce or salt if you prefer it.
>**Tips**: You can always use a pressure cooker to speed up the process of tendering the beef. Just make sure you still follow Step 1 first. The ingredients in Step 3 are the only ones that goes while you pressure cook the beef. The short ribs should be tender enough 30 minutes after the pressure cooker whistles.
